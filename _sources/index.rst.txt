welcome to my github page!
=========================================

Hi, I'm Kevin. I live in the boonies of Redmond, WA - about halfway between Seattle and Snoqualmie Pass.

I moved out here from Montana (go Bobcats!) and continue to be a powder snob while occasionally working on my trail-building chops.

These days I am helping Hydrosat launch their constellation of thermal imaging satellites, so that we can all enjoy the benefits of daily land-surface temperature measurements. I look for projects that allow me to blend my technical cababilities with missions that matter, so it's a good fit.
